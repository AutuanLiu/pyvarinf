# PyVarInf
PyVarInf provides facilities to easily train your PyTorch neural network
models using variational inference.

# Requirements
You need to have PyTorch installed for PyVarInf to work (as PyTorch is not
readily available on PyPi). To install PyTorch, follow the instructions described
[here](http://pytorch.org/#pip-install-pytorch).
